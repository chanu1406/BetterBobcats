This file is used to design and plan a way for clubs to submit request to be added to the BetterBobcats platform.

The general flow:

Club officers hit a sign up page. 
Fill out information:
    - Club name
    - description
    - Contact information
    - Officer emails/ numbers
    - website
    - slug(Autogenerate for them or allow them to create)
    - logo_url
    - banner_url

- > 

This will be sent to our admin dashboard as a request to be a club on BetterBobcats

-> We in the admin dashboard have a review page where we review these clubs.

if(accepted):
    - Our program sends out an email to the emails in the club form letting them know their club has been approved.
    - Send out credentials: or come up with some sort of Oauth system that allows them to use google or whatever they prefer.

if(rejected):
    - On admin dashboard we can fill out a message of why they have been rejected.
     - Whether it is because they lacked sufficent information.
     - Not active enough 
Up to us at that point

If a club has been accepted:
We want to have some page only accessible to that club where they can manage for now these things:
- Their clubs details on BetterBobcats
- Post events that their club will be hosting
- Remove events
- Edit events. 

TBD Need to figure out:
- Whether we create an individual dashboard for each club. May be efficent:
- Have one club dashboard that takes in props of which club is being looked at.
    -Pulls that clubs specfiic information into the dashboard.


Questions:
- How we will authenticate club admins and make sure they can only access their dashboard.
- How to make sure they only have access to their clubs data and can't edit any other clubs information.
- How we can set up an approval and rejection system.
- How to set up Oauth in our use case. 
- Whether it is better for us to generate them a username and password or what is the best option
- Whether to make individual dashboards in our codebase or have one dashboard that pulls information based on which club is signed in.
