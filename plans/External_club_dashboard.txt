    Now we are planning how the events work:
    - We will have a database that stores an event this database will store all events from all clubs and will be used to make a big
    monthly caleder showing all events posted by all clubs.

    - What info we want stored:
        Core fields (must-have)

        id (uuid)

        club_id (uuid, FK → clubs)

        title (text) — “Event Name”

        description (text) — short + long (can be one field v1)

        starts_at (timestamptz)

        ends_at (timestamptz) — optional but strongly recommended (calendar needs duration)

        timezone (text) — optional if you always store timestamptz; still useful for display

        location_name (text) — “COB 120” / “ACS 102”

        location_address (text) — optional for off-campus

        location_type (text) — on_campus | off_campus | online | hybrid

        online_url (text) — Zoom/Meet link (nullable)


Audience & filtering (for your “big calendar”)

visibility (text) — public | members_only | unlisted

major_targets (many-to-many) — store via join table:

event_majors(event_id, major_id)

and support “All majors” by either:

no rows = all, OR

a boolean is_all_majors (easier for queries)

tags (optional but high value) — event_tags(event_id, tag) (resume, workshop, social, career, hackathon)

capacity (int) — optional

requires_rsvp (bool)

rsvp_url (text) — Google form / Eventbrite / etc.

Media / presentation (nice-to-have, but worth it)

banner_url (text) — makes calendar/list look legit

thumbnail_url (text) — optional

attachments (later) — link table for flyers/pdf

Control & safety fields (important for moderation + debugging)

status (text) — draft | published | cancelled

cancelled_reason (text) — optional

created_at, updated_at (timestamptz)

created_by (uuid) — auth.uid

updated_by (uuid)

published_at (timestamptz) — optional

Helpful extras (still simple, very practical)

is_featured (bool) — for homepage highlights

contact_email (citext) — who to reach out to

check_in_url / check_in_code (later, for attendance)

“All majors” design choice (pick one)
Option A (clean queries): is_all_majors boolean

If true, ignore join table

If false, use event_majors


Minimal V1: what I’d actually ship first

events

id, club_id

title, description

starts_at, ends_at

location_type, location_name, online_url

visibility (public)

status (published)

banner_url (optional)

is_all_majors (default true)

created_at, created_by, updated_at

event_majors

event_id, major_id (only used when is_all_majors=false)
            
That’s enough to build:

big monthly calendar

event detail page

club dashboard “create/edit event”
